CS50 Final Project

My Final Project for CS50 is a web application using Flask, Python, JavaScipt and SQL.
My application is named "SoKnow"
it lets you read good books that are availble for free in public domain
My aplication lets you sign up sign in put up your picture
It also has Admin Dashboard which lets only admin upload new books, book covers etc watch all the database except user passwords
